This plugin make easy (and fun) the insertion of Jeroen Wijerings Player

== Description ==

It's a plugin that integrate the JW Player, a very good flash video player that can play the videos that you want, on your WordPress blog, with a very very simple options page (i love the simple things). :)

= But why to use it, if exist services how YouTube and Yahoo! Videos? =

I made it per a simple objective: I was tired to have to talk with Youtube for something, per example, with a background sound of a video protected by VEVO, an alliance of the YouTube and big producers. I desire total freedom of expression, i desire to post the video that i wanted, with the control that i wanted, without dependences of the big Google or of the Yahoo Videos!, so i make Shine Yellow. :)


= But and it's vantage for it's concurrents, how WordTube? =
* It uses the latest version of the JW Player (5.0.753), the latest library of the SWF Object (2.2), the latest version of the JS Color (1.3.1), the latest version of Viral (2.0), of Tweet It! (1.0) and Facebook It! (1.0). It's the first plugin to WordPress to JW Player to use this file versions, and even now, the just one. :)
* Have a complete documentation about all the functions of it! You certainly won't have any question about the plugin! :)
* The SWF Object library is loaded direct from Google Servers, the big of the internet, without congest your blog!
* Do not uses the "defer" attribute (that defines the player load for just when the page is totally loaded). The problem of the defer is that the page needs to be all loaded to player appear, with Shine Yellow it does not happen, because the video is loaded when scrollbar are near of it, making the visitant happy.
* It have native support to plugins. Cool! :) And in the future i want to add more plugins to it.
* It does not load the SWF Object library on the header, it's load just when a video is posted, making your blog much more fast! :)

= More? =
* Easily integrate JW Player into your WordPress blog.
* It support the formats: FLV, MP4, MP3 and YouTube Videos!
* You can choise different options for every video that you post! Per example, a player skin different to a video. :)
* With the QuickTag, you add your video quickly on your WordPress blog!
* You can choise easily the color of your player/plugins to it combine with your blog, also your player/plugins options. It went the firt add-in to JW Player to the WordPress platform to offear native support to plugins.
* It load really fast, and your options page too. All went be very good preparated and compressed to turn your experience the best possible! :)
* Native support to video thumbnails, also for playlists.
